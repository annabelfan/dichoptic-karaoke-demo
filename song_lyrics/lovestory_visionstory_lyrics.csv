0.0,17,Intro
17.5,21.0,I was young when my ret’na met light
21.5,25.0,"I close my eyes, and scene starts playing"
25.5,33.0,It’s early days. Circuits still form in the morning air
33.5,38.0,"In a sea of neurons, looking for connections"
38.5,41.0,See neurons fire through a crowd
41.5,49.0,And say “Hello.” Little did they know
50.0,53.5,Signals were climbing up the optic nerve screaming
54.0,56.5,"“Here is more input, so don’t you lose what you deserve!”"
57.0,59.5,I hope these signals will not decay
60.0,63.0,And my connections stay-ay-ay
64.0,65.5,Then I said
66.0,69.5,"Visual cortex, somewhere we can map the world"
70.0,73.5,"Synapses pruning, but the timing is unfurled"
74.0,78.5,"If we add some noise now, maybe pathways can stay—"
79.0,82.0,It’s a vision story… plasticity finds a way
86.0,90.0,"Early stripes, they are here lining my V1"
90.5,94.0,Dominance columns findin’ their routine
94.5,96.0,LGN sends
96.5,101.5,"Signals perfect tidy rows, oh, oh"
102.0,105.5,“Using both my eyes now—my binocular strength grows!”
106.0,109.5,But then deprivation starts messing with the plan
110.0,116.0,"Deprived eye, neurons pick a side. Lazy eye is getting suppressed"
117.0,118.0,Still I said—
118.5,121.5,"Visual cortex, somewhere we can map the world"
122.0,125.0,"Synapses pruning, but the timing is unfurled"
125.5,130.5,"If we add some noise now, maybe pathways can stay—"
131.0,134.0,It’s a vision story… plasticity finds a way
134.5,138.0,"Visual cortex, guide me—tell me circuits can adapt"
138.5,142.0,Give the kids good input or their system might collapse
142.5,147.0,Is it too late now? Are the pathways still developing?
147.5,151.0,It’s a vision story...plasticy makes it okay
153.0,156.0,Oh-Ohhh
165.0,169.0,Critical windows closing
169.5,173.0,As I keep growing past the age 10
173.5,178.0,Perceptual learning swoops in
179.0,182.5,“Let’s make that weaker eye win!” And I said-
183.0,187.0,"Visual cortex, somewhere we can map the world"
187.5,189.5,"Synapses pruning, but the timing is unfurled"
190.0,195.0,"If we add some noise now, maybe pathways can stay—"
195.5,199.0,It’s a vision story… plasticity finds a way
200.5,203.0,"Visual cortex, guide me—tell me circuits can adapt"
203.5,206.5,Give the kids good input or their system might collapse
207.0,210.0,Is it too late now? Are the pathways still developing?
210.5,218.0,It’s a vision story...plasticy makes it okay
218.5,222.0,"Oh, oh"
222.5,226.0,"Oh, oh-oh, oh"
227.0,233.0,Because we were young when the retina first met light…
